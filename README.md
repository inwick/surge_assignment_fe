This is a front end of this project. There are 2 user types as a Admin and student. Admin is added to the system via back end seed file (admin will add after run the backend). After login to the admin, thay can add users to the systm and view already students profiles. When add a student to the system admin need to enter the user's email and set a default password. Thsen those credentials will send to the users email address. Using that credentials students can log in to the system.

After login to the system as a student if he/she is a newly added student, they need to fill the other personal details and change the password. Then they will again re direct to the login page. If user is already setup the profile, they can log in to the system directly. After student login complete, they can add a note with a title and a description. And also, they can update those details and can delete the note as well.

If any time, user need to logout, they can use logout button in the navigation bar.
